      Hello! My name is Joanna. I'm 17 years old and from Chicago, Illinois. I will binge anything from books and video games to TV shows and anime if it means following an engaging storyline. On this website, you can find out a little bit more about me and view some of the awesome projects Iâ€™ve been working on as of late!
